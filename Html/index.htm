<h1>EYATU PHILIP ESAMU</h1>
		<p>I’m Eyatu Philip Esamu, currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Information Technology (BIT) at Cavendish University. I’m in my first year, second semester, and already deeply passionate about tech and the limitless opportunities it offers.

Interests and Goals: I’m on a journey to become a hands-on full stack developer, with a vision to drive tech innovations both at Cavendish University and globally. My aim is not just to excel in development but to become a champion of technological progress, pushing boundaries and finding creative solutions to everyday challenges.

Hobbies: Coding is my greatest passion, I spend a lot of time working on different projects and sharpening my skills. I’m also a huge fan of video games, which inspire me to think critically and creatively.

Philosophy: I believe that "the best way to learn developing is by developing." This means that I don’t just focus on theory but actively build, experiment, and explore new technologies to stay ahead in this fast-paced field.

Culmination: As I continue my journey, I’m excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead and am committed to making an impact in the tech world, one project at a time.</p>
